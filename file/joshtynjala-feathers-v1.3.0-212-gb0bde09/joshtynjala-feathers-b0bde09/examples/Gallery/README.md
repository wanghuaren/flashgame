# Gallery Example for Feathers

Displays a simple gallery of images from the [Flickr API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) using [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/). This example shows how to use a horizontal layout and a custom item renderer with a List component. Additionally, this example demonstrates how to [extend a theme](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/extending-themes) by adding a new style to the `MetalWorksMobileTheme` example theme.

## Requirements

In addition to Starling Framwork and Feathers, this example project requires the MetalWorksMobileTheme example theme. You can find the SWC file for this theme at the following location in the Feathers release build:

	themes/MetalWorksMobileTheme/swc/MetalWorksMobileTheme.swc

Additionally, you will need a [Flickr API key](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/). Pass in this API key by defining a conditional constant named `CONFIG::FLICKR_API_KEY`. If you are compiling with an IDE, conditional constants are usually defined somewhere in your project's settings. On the command line, you may use the `-define` compiler argument:

	-define+=CONFIG::FLICKR_API_KEY,'your flickr api key'
